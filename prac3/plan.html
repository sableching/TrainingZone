<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Make a website to increase revenue for the company by promoting the company's services to attract both new and repeat customers.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>By comparing the difference in revenue earned from before and after the website has been published. Since all other advertising methods will remain constant,
 any significant increase and decrease in revenue would likely be due to the new website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Local residents, mature age job seekers (28-50). They were chosen as this group makes up the majority of the company's current audience. I will design the site such that there is few colours so as not to distract the users from the content. I will also make sure that the content is organised in an orderly and structured manner.</p>
